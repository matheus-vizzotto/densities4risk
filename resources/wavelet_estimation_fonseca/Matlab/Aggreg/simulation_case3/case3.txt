In case 3 we use the vector of weights (0.1,0.3,0.5).

p = 5;  % lag máximo utilizado
alpha = .05;  % nível de significância do teste bootstrap
vw = [0.1,0.3,0.5]'; % vetor de pesos
nt = 500;  % número de pontos para cada dia


The number of replications for d=2 was 200, with 200 bootstraps
The number of replications for d=4 was 200, with 200 bootstraps
The number of replications for d=2 was 200, with 200 bootstraps
